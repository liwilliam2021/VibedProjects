4. **Sprite Variety**: The 11 available dinosaurs provide good variety, but reaching the advertised 15 would be beneficial

## Conclusion

The enhanced dinosaur sprites significantly improve the visual quality of the tower defense game. All tested dinosaurs display their anatomical features clearly, with smooth animations and no performance impact. While some iconic dinosaurs (T-Rex, Triceratops) are missing from the current selection, the 11 available dinosaurs provide excellent variety and visual appeal. The game is fully playable and enjoyable with the enhanced sprites.

**Overall Rating: 8.5/10** - Excellent visual enhancement with minor room for improvement in dinosaur variety.
